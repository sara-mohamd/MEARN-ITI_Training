<h3>Project Overview</h3>
CSSandHTMLArtistry is an individual project aimed at demonstrating various HTML and CSS techniques. The project includes a multi-page layout, where each page offers unique content and interactive features. All pages are displayed within the same layout, maintaining a consistent and cohesive user experience.

<h3>Features</h3>
HTML & CSS Only: Purely designed with HTML and CSS, without using any JavaScript or other frameworks.
Single Page Layout: All pages are integrated into a single layout for a seamless navigation experience.
Interactive Elements: Hover effects, dynamic content changes, and sliders add interactivity.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes.
<h3>Pages</h3>
<h4>Home</h4>
The home page serves as an introduction and can include an image and some information about you. It's the first impression, setting the tone for the rest of the site.

<h4>Hobbies</h4>
This page showcases your hobbies with images. Hovering over each image will zoom in, providing a closer look at your interests.

<h4>Birthday</h4>
A unique page that starts with an image and, after 5 seconds, transitions to a textarea and submit button. Users can write a kind message for your birthday, and upon submission, they are redirected to a thank you message, all within the same layout.

<h4>Contact Us</h4>
This page includes a contact form and images linking to your social media accounts, providing an easy way for visitors to connect with you.

<h4>Travel Wishlist</h4>
A slider displaying images of countries you wish to visit, with the name of each country displayed above its respective image. This page visually captures your travel aspirations.

<h4>CV</h4>
Your CV page includes detailed information about your personal and professional background, skills, and other relevant details.

<h4>How to Use<h4>
To view the project, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Navigation between the pages is handled within the same layout, providing a smooth and unified browsing experience.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
HTML: Structuring the content and layout.
CSS: Styling and adding interactivity to the pages.
